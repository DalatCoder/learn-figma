| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focus on customer experience | Focus on the internal, the thing that makes the product works |

The phases of building any products

| Phase       | Job                                                                                                                                              | For                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |

## 1. Meeting the client

- We are creating a new product
- Product designer: can design on any platform: web, mobile, ...
- Client wants to build a massive shop online that can takes on Amazon

## 2. Sketching

Used for:

- Idea generation
- Flow

### 2.1. An intro to sketching

Sketching is a two step process:

- Idea generation: generate as many ideas as we can > Sketch
- Add detail: it's ok to kill some ideas in here > Refine

![Image](assets/sketching.png)

From idea generation to refinement

### 2.2. The sketching process

Step 1: Be prepared!

- Prepare your tools beforehand
- What are your goals?
- Who is your audience?
- Time-box yourself

Step 2: Ready, Set ... Go!

- Draw a frame for your device
- Start with more simple and redundant elements: footer, header, elements that you have seen alot
- Move onto some more detailed interactions: square, rectangle, circle, line, ...
- Annotate your sketches and keep them safe
- Keep going
- Share your sketches

Step 3: Refinement

- Add titles to your sketches

![Image](assets/addtitletosketches.png)

- Add annotations... again

![Image](assets/addannotation.png)

- Use numbers

![Image](assets/usenumbers.png)

- Use arrows

![Image](assets/addarrows.png)

- Add gestures if you want

![Image](assets/addgesture.png)

### 2.3. Sketching user flows #1 (Overrall flow)

- Think about what your want to sketch
- Define some sort of starting point: the most difficult or the quicky part first, some designers
  start at the end and then figure out the way to achieve it
- Design your next step, ask yourself some important questions

  - which ways this step lead our users?
  - where do you want them to go?
  - what are the users need to do to get there?

![Image](assets/atob.png)

- Happy flow: user enter the app and make purcharge

## 4. Intro to Figma

Advantages:

- It's free for individuals
- Collaborative
- Fast
- Works on any computer
- Mobile companion app

## 5. User flows

### 5.1. What are user flows?

A user flow is a seri of steps that user takes to achieve a meaningful goal

![Image](assets/userflow.png)

![Image](assets/userflow1.png)

An example

![Image](assets/userflow2.png)

Some questions

- What is the goal of this thing
- Who is doing it
- How do they do it

The proces of creating a user flow

![Image](assets/userflow3.png)

![Image](assets/userflow4.png)

![Image](assets/userflow5.png)

### 5.2. The `do` and `don't`

![Image](assets/dont.png)

![Image](assets/do.png)

![Image](assets/dont1.png)

![Image](assets/do1.png)

![Image](assets/dont2.png)

![Image](assets/do2.png)

### 5.3. Speedup workflow with component

Create some simple shapes

![Image](assets/component1.png)

Create reusable components

- Choose a shape
- Right click > Create component

For some `text shape` on the screen, we can group them into one `frame` and
create component from this `frame`

When edit size of the shape inside a `frame` (`component`), we can edit the constraint
to automatically resize the shape base on the size of the `frame`

![Image](assets/component2.png)

### 5.4. Creating our own user flows (On boarding)

The flow that user sees when they first enter the app

- Press 'f' to create new frame
- Switch to tab `assets` to uses our components from previous step

![Image](assets/onboarding.png)

Steps to create user flows

- Create a `title`
- Create `step` and write description

  - What the user sees
  - What they do
  - What they see next
  - What they do next

![Image](assets/onboarding1.png)

### 5.5. Creating our own user flows (Find products)

![Image](assets/searchproduct.png)

### 5.6. Creating our own user flows (Making a purchase)

![Image](assets/makingapurchase.png)

## 6. Sitemaps

### 6.1. Introduction to sitemaps

People still use sitemap?

![Image](assets/sitemap1.png)

![Image](assets/sitemap2)

When do we use sitemaps?

- The very beginning
- Right after the project is kick-off

### 6.2. Create a basic sitemap

![Image](assets/sitemap3.png)

![Image](assets/sitemap4.png)

![Image](assets/sitemap5.png)

There are 2 types of sitemaps:

- Flat sitemap: for small products, less than 100 pages
- Deep sitemap: for large products

![Image](assets/sitemap6.png)

![Image](assets/sitemap7.png)

So why they are valualbe?

- Provide an overview
- Sitemaps can help strategically place content where users can find it.
  It results in the creation of your navigation and hierarchies of your product.

### 6.3. Before start

- Place all of sketch images to the figma page
- Review all the sketches
- Review all user flows

![Image](assets/sitemap8.png)

### 6.4. Building sitemaps

Using `plugin autoflow` to create line between `frames`

![Image](assets/sitemap9.png)

![Image](assets/sitemap10.png)

![Image](assets/sitemap11.png)

### 6.7. Tips on creating sitemaps

- Thinking out of the box, don't go to detail such as user flow
- Using tools: figma,... sketching first and then move to some online tools to refine
- Using colors
- Spent less time on the sitemaps

## 7. Wireframes

### 7.1. What is a wireframe

> Wireframes are a blueprint of your product

- Middle-ground between your sketching and high-quality design in prototype

Past artifcats should influence the way you create your wireframes

![Image](assets/wireframe.png)

Why do we use them?

- Wireframes help you understand how users will navigate your product
- Use them to learn: build > measure > learn
- Clarity and common understanding amongst the team
- Testing with users uncovers pain points and opportunities
- Present to clients and stakeholders to get feedback

Use them to:

- Show to the client
- Quickly prototype without worrying about styles, colors

### 7.2. How to create a wireframe?

- Keep it simple
- Pencil and paper is a good way to start (quick)
- You can polish them up if you have a client that you want to review with
- Ask yourself the important questions

  - The goals?
  - How content is organized to support those content?
  - What is the user expect to see on the page

- Consult your user flows and sitemap
- Tackle risky features first
- Bring your team into the process

### 7.3. Wireframe in Figma

For quickly:

- Components library
- Style guide

The generalize component for quickly starting

![Image](assets/component3.png)

### 7.4. Creating our home page

We have done

- Sketching
- User flows
- Sitemaps

Create new wireframe

![Image](assets/homewireframe.png)

The first things to do is starting with basic things like

- Navigation
- ...

Insert `bar` component, swap icons and using pass through 40% for transperency

![Image](assets/homewireframe1.png)

Using `grid` for easily align items

![Image](assets/homewireframe2.png)

Complete home page wireframe

![Image](assets/homewireframe3.png)

![Image](assets/homewireframe4.png)

## 8. Prototyping

### 8.1. Trigger

Our wireframe

![Image](assets/prototype1.png)

Prototyping basics:

- Select tab `prototype`
- Select device `iphone 11 pro`

Configure device

![Image](assets/prototype2.png)

We can now press `present` button

![Image](assets/prototype3.png)

Trigger:

- On Tap
- On Drag
- While Hovering
- While Pressing
- Key/Gamepad
- Mouse Enter
- Mouse Leave
- Touch Down
- Touch Up

On Tap trigger: user click or press on a button or anything to move to another frame

![Image](assets/prototype4.png)

On Drag trigger: perform actions when you drag an element on the screen

![Image](assets/prototype5.png)

Recommends:

- `On Tap` for everything: just want prototype to link together to test

### 8.2. Action

- Navigate To
- Open Overlay
- Swap With
- Back
- Close Overlay
- Open Link

Open Keyboard Overlay when user click on the search bar and close the overlay when user click outside the `Keyboard frame`

Notice: the high of the `Keyboard frame`

![Image](assets/prototype6.png)

### 8.3. Overflow behaviour

Control how your user interact with content that extends beyond the
`frame` dimension

![Image](assets/prototype7.png)

## 9. Spacing and The Grid

### 9.1. What is a grid?

Grid helps designer aligns content on the page

![Image](assets/grid.png)

### 9.2. Grid basics?

- Base units, the author uses `8px` base units

![Image](assets/baseunit.png)

- All UI elements should be measured in increments of our base unit

![Image](assets/baseunit1.png)

- Padding: The space between all of our elements should be based off of our base unit

![Image](assets/baseunit2.png)

Layout, so what do all these lines and boxes mean?

Grid anotomies:

- Column
- Gutter
- Margin

Columns are our vertical blocks that span from left to right

- Desktop: 12
- Tablet: 8
- Mobile: 6

![Image](assets/grid1.png)

Gutters are that white space between columns

- Stay fixed
- Don't scale up or down
- 16px

![Image](assets/grid2.png)

Margins are the white space between the edge of your column
and the edge of the frame

![Image](assets/grid3.png)

There are different types of grid

The Manuscript Grid

- Define margin for a large block of text

![Image](assets/grid4.png)

The most popular column grid

![Image](assets/grid5.png)

The modular grid

![Image](assets/grid6.png)

The baseline grid (important, 4px base units)

- Provide guide for typography and UI elements
- Create vertical rhythms
- Place typography on the baseline grid using `line height`
- `Line height` is the box around the type

![Image](assets/grid7.png)

![Image](assets/grid8.png)

### 9.3. Responsive grids and breakpoints

Design for multiple screens

- Fixed Grid: has fixed container

![Image](assets/grid9.png)

![Image](assets/grid10.png)

- Fluid Grid: using percentage (%), margin & gutter stay fixed

![Image](assets/grid11.png)

![Image](assets/grid12.png)

- Responsive Grid: breakpoints (small, medium, large, extra large)

![Image](assets/grid13.png)

## 10. Typography

### 10.1. Serif

Traditional

![Image](assets/serif.png)

There are 4 categories of `serif`

![Image](assets/serif1.png)

### 10.2. Sans Serif

![Image](assets/sanserif.png)
