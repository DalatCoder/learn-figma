### 5.3. Speedup workflow with component

Create some simple shapes

![Image](assets/component1.png)

Create reusable components

- Choose a shape
- Right click > Create component

For some `text shape` on the screen, we can group them into one `frame` and
create component from this `frame`

When edit size of the shape inside a `frame` (`component`), we can edit the constraint
to automatically resize the shape base on the size of the `frame`
